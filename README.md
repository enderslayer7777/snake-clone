# Snake Clone

## Description
This project is a JavaScript based implementation of the classic Snake arcade game (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)).

The controls of the game are as follows:
- __Spacebar:__ starts the game
- __Arrow Keys:__ move the snake

Points are scored by having the snake eat food tiles. The game is over when the snake crashes into a wall or its own body.

## Installation
The game can be played by downloading the project and opening the __Snake.html__ file in a browser.
Alternatively, the game can be played on my personal website (http://rdouglascanada.com/play-snake/).
If you are interested in putting a copy of my clone on your personal website, feel free. If you have a WordPress website, then you may be interested in my <a href="https://github.com/rdouglascanada/wp-snake">WordPress plugin</a>.

The game works best in the Opera and Google Chrome browsers, is slower in Mozilla Firefox, and does not work at all in Internet Explorer or Microsoft Edge. Safari has not yet been tested.
